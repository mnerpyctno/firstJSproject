# My first JavaScript project 

My first JavaScript project as part of Ivan Petrichenko's course "A complete course in JavaScript + React - from zero to pro".

## What is this project about?

The project consists of one page from a potentially large site with movies, on which it is possible to add favorite and watched movies to personal profile.

## What I've learned

* Work with a simulated database
* Work with DOM and event handling
* Sort arrays

## Features

1. Add watched movies.
2. Mark movies as favorite.
3. Delete movies from the list.
